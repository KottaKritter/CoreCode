# CoreCode
## Week 1 Tuesday Challenge
### Java language is compiled or interpreted? 
It is both, the code is first compiled into bycode that the Java Runtime Enviroment(JRE) can understand, and then this bycode is interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine(JVM). The use of bycode makes the intepretation much quicker.
### Why is pseudocode helpful?
It allows you to organize your ideas and to decide how the code will actually work, by just adding the steps to it. It helps understand how the code will work or what the code will do without having to actually write it.
### Pseudo code to calculate age based on year. 
1- Define variable 'year' equal input, input will ask for the year they were born
2- Define varibale 'age'  equal to  2022 - variable 'year'
3- Print 'age' with the result
### Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?
Flowcharts are useful to demostrate the logic behind a program, it is also helpful when creating a new program, so it can be use to find the correct proces to follow or how the program should work before coding it. It is similar to pseudo code as it provides an idea and logic to the code without havint to actual code, but in an a graphic form easier to understand to non coders.
